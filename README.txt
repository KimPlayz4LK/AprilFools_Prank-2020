# AprilFools_Prank-2020
A prank for April Fools of 2020.

To start the prank, just open the file named "AprilFools_Prank1.vbs" and then it will begin the joke.
If you want to make it start automatically, just open it before the april fools day.
So the next time your victim logs-in on the account where you have installed the joke, the fun will begin automatically.

NOTE: The program will start always automatically after being opened. So to remove it, ask me (ask for help)
or just wait 'till the music ends and all the mess will be removed automatically.
